# The Vault

The Vault is a secure, lightweight application designed to store your passwords **locally** on your device. Built with ElectronJS, it provides a seamless cross-platform experience. With no reliance on external servers, your sensitive data remains under your control, eliminating the risk of data breaches or server hacks.

## Features

- **Local Storage Only**: All passwords are securely stored on your device.
- **Encryption**: Passwords are encrypted using strong algorithms to protect your data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for managing passwords.
- **Offline Access**: No internet connection required to access your saved passwords.
- **Cross-Platform**: Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. (to be added shortly...plan to deploy the app in the near future)
